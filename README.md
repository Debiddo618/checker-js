# Checkers

## Descriptions:

This is a two-player checkers game created using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Players will take turns moving their checker pieces by clicking them and then an empty space. The winner will be determined when one player loses all their pieces or is unable to make another move. This project emphasizes functions, object-oriented programming, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
